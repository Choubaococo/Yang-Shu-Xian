This is my Fyp : geohazard data crawler
GeoServer allows users to share, process and edit geospatial data. 
Designed for interoperability, it publishes data from any major spatial data source using open standards.
GeoServer has evolved to become an easy method of connecting existing information to virtual globes.
The system explores the open geospatial data and crawl the existing events, 
then import it to GeoServer databases and able to display the latest information as map in web such as google earth.
